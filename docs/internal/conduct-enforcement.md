# Code of Conduct Enforcement Procedure

This document describes how the PivotStream maintainer team handles Code of Conduct reports.

## Who Handles Reports
Reports are handled by the maintainer team. If a report involves a maintainer, that person will be recused from the investigation.

## Response Time
We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and provide status updates during the process.

## Investigation Process
1. Acknowledge receipt and confirm the scope of the report.
2. Collect relevant context (links, screenshots, timestamps, participants).
3. Interview involved parties when appropriate.
4. Assess behavior against the Code of Conduct.
5. Decide on action and document the rationale.

## Possible Consequences
Depending on severity and context, actions may include:
- A private warning
- A request for apology or corrective action
- Temporary restrictions (mute, lock, or access suspension)
- Permanent removal from community spaces

## Appeal Process
If a participant disagrees with a decision, they may appeal by emailing admin@rachetsurgery.com with additional context. Appeals are reviewed by maintainers who were not part of the original decision.
